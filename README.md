### Inspiration

This game was inspirred by the [endless runner game](https://www.emanueleferonato.com/tag/endless-runner/) (5 parts tutorial). An inspiration was drawn to design a simple but creative game, and implement it using Phaser. Therefore, I did spend some time designing the game before programming it.
